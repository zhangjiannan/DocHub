DocHub!

DocHub is a new version control tool for document management and sharing, given the fact that Github is popular in code version control but complicated in its workflow, and is partially blocked in China.

Google doc is of course an alternative, however it has less functionalities for version control, branching, etc. Also it is totally blocked in China.

Why do we care about sharing documents?

1. We want to have version control on general documents, but simplify the workflow by the following changes: a. remove the use a commend-line tool, put all operations on cloud; b. only has "save" (to personal space) and "submit" (to public space), so that everybody has confidence to use it.

2. Recently we saw GitHub's Government document page, and people using GitHub to write books, also given the fact that we hope to build a platform for people to share challenges, and we organize Hackathons around different countries, e.g. CERN Webfest 2013, eXtreme Learning Process at Tsinghua University, and the need to get hackers and all sorts of people working together, we realized that the tool should be invented to support all these stuff.
